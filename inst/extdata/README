** Table S1 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc2.xls
All proteins identified in this study, including the IPI and UniProt accession numbers (hyperlinked to the UniProt Knowledgebase) and a description of the protein. Following these entries are the sequence coverage (as percent) and the number of unique peptides observed for each protein, as well as the sequences of those unique peptides.

** Table S3 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc4.xls
Protein correlation profiles for each measured protein from three different sets of experiments: high and low-density sucrose gradients, and cytoplasm versus nucleus. In each worksheet the IPI and UniProt codes, as well as protein names and measured abundances (expressed as  log10[ion intensity]), are listed before the normalized abundances of each protein in each 2 fraction. The high-density page contains ion intensities for only the first eight fractions (Fr01-08) while the low-density page contains information for fractions 09 through 30 (Fr25-29 were not included as they are equivalent to Fr30).

Each worksheet has been opened in gnumeric and saved as a csv file.

Sheet 2 (PCP-Low density):  PIIS0092867406003692.mmc4-lowDensity.csv
Sheet 3 (Cytoplasm or Nucleus): not used here

** Table S4 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc5.xls
Peptide correlation profiles for each measured peptide from three different sets of experiments: high and low-density sucrose gradients, and cytoplasm versus nucleus (three separate worksheets). In each worksheet the charge state, molecular weight and amino acid sequence  of each peptide precede the measured ion volumes (in Da·s). The high-density page contains ion intensities for only the first eight fractions (Fr01-08) while the low-density page contains information for fractions 09 through 30 (Fr25-29 were not included as they are equivalent to Fr30).

Each worksheet has been opened in gnumeric and saved as a csv file.

** Table S5 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc6.xls
Localizations for all proteins measured in this study. IPI and UniProt accession codes, protein descriptions, abundances and the number of peptides upon which the localization was based are listed in the first five columns of each sheet. In the Localizations Sheet the subsequent columns contain the χ2 values for that protein’s PCP versus the marker for the given organelle where the protein met the assignment criteria (see Experimental Procedures). Where the assignment criteria were not met (e.g., where the χ2 value was higher than the cutoff) no value is shown. The fold enrichments for proteins in the nucleus are indicated in the Cytoplasm/Nucleus column (only those proteins enriched more than two-fold). In the Refined Locations Sheet the result of evaluating our measured localizations versus the published literature is shown (see Experimental Procedures). 'Yes' was assigned where annotation indicated the protein was in the organelle but also in the case where secreted proteins were identified in the secretory pathway (ER, ERGDV, Golgi). 'No' was assigned where the measured location was not among the annotated locations for a protein. 'Probably' was assigned in several instances: 1) where no location was otherwise annotated, 2) where a protein annotated as cytosolic was measured in an organelle since it would encounter than organelle and could be specifically associated with it, 3) where a protein annotated as nuclear was found in the cytosol since most proteins are not completely excluded by the nuclear pore, 4) where a non-proteasomal protein was found in the proteasome since most proteins are degraded by this machinery at some point, 5) where cytoskeletal proteins were measured in an organelle. 'Co-migrating' was assigned for ribosomal proteins that peaked in fractions 17 and/or 19.

Marker proteins have been extracted from the paper, second paragraph on page 188:

To determine the PCP of well-studied organelles, we
examined the profiles of several well-characterized
marker proteins, including 130 kDa Golgi phosphoprotein
(GPP130, Golgi), AP-2 assembly subunit AP17 (plasma
membrane [PM]), early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1, early
endosomes [EE]), transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2, recycling
endosome [RE]), calnexin (ER), p115 (ER/Golgi-derived
vesicles [ERGDV]), and F1-F0 ATP synthase b subunit (mi-
tochondria). Each of these markers peaked in different
gradient fractions and had distinct profiles; thus at least
these seven organelles could be distinguished with confi-
dence (Figure 2B). Markers of other compartments were
also observed, but their profiles matched closely to one
of the seven mentioned above. In particular, ERGIC-53,
a marker for the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment,
overlapped very closely with the ER, as has been reported
previously (Breuza et al., 2004). Likewise, the profiles of
cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and
adaptor-related protein 1b, markers of the late endosome
and trans-Golgi network, respectively, largely overlapped
with TfR2 (Tables S3 and S4). This suggests that these
compartments migrate similarly in rate-zonal centrifuga-
tion and is in agreement with the specialized conditions re-
quired for even partial segregation reported by others
(Tulp et al., 1998; Hashiramoto and James, 2000).

Organelle marker had a chi2 scores of 0 for the expected organelle, except where otherwise noted:

- PM: AP-2 assembly subunit AP17 (AP-2 assembly subunit AP17) - IPI00118022 
- EE (early endosome): early endosome antigen 1 - IPI00453776 [a]
- TGN/RE (recycling endosome): Transferrin receptor protein 2 - IPI00223651
- ER: Calnexin precursor - IPI00119618
- ERGDV (ER/Golgi-derived vesicles): Vesicle docking protein - IPI00128071 [b]
- Mito: ATP synthase beta chain, mitochondrial precursor - IPI00113801

              Proteasome subunit alpha type 6 - IPI00131845 [d]
