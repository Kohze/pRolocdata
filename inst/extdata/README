** Table S1 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc2.xls
All proteins identified in this study, including the IPI and UniProt
accession numbers (hyperlinked to the UniProt Knowledgebase) and a

the single letter IUPAC nomenclature, the best relative mass error
measured for each (in parts per million), the highest Mascot IonsScore
recorded for each and the number of amino acids in each.

** Table S3 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc4.xls
Protein correlation profiles for each measured protein from three
different sets of experiments: high and low-density sucrose gradients,
and cytoplasm versus nucleus. In each worksheet the IPI and UniProt
codes, as well as protein names and measured abundances (expressed as
log10[ion intensity]), are listed before the normalized abundances of
each protein in each 2 fraction. The high-density page contains ion
intensities for only the first eight fractions (Fr01-08) while the
low-density page contains information for fractions 09 through 30
(Fr25-29 were not included as they are equivalent to Fr30).

Each worksheet has been opened in gnumeric and saved as a csv file.

Sheet 2 (PCP-Low density):  PIIS0092867406003692.mmc4-lowDensity.csv
Sheet 3 (Cytoplasm or Nucleus): not used here

** Table S4 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc5.xls
Peptide correlation profiles for each measured peptide from three
different sets of experiments: high and low-density sucrose gradients,
and cytoplasm versus nucleus (three separate worksheets). In each
worksheet the charge state, molecular weight and amino acid sequence
of each peptide precede the measured ion volumes (in Da). The
high-density page contains ion intensities for only the first eight
fractions (Fr01-08) while the low-density page contains information
for fractions 09 through 30 (Fr25-29 were not included as they are
equivalent to Fr30).

Each worksheet has been opened in gnumeric and saved as a csv file.

Sheet 3 (Cytoplasm or Nucleus): not used here

** Table S5 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc6.xls
Localizations for all proteins measured in this study. IPI and UniProt accession codes, protein descriptions, abundances and the number of peptides upon which the localization was based are listed in the first five columns of each sheet. In the Localizations Sheet the subsequent columns contain the χ2 values for that protein’s PCP versus the marker for the given organelle where the protein met the assignment criteria (see Experimental Procedures). Where the assignment criteria were not met (e.g., where the χ2 value was higher than the cutoff) no value is shown. The fold enrichments for proteins in the nucleus are indicated in the Cytoplasm/Nucleus column (only those proteins enriched more than two-fold). In the Refined Locations Sheet the result of evaluating our measured localizations versus the published literature is shown (see Experimental Procedures). 'Yes' was assigned where annotation indicated the protein was in the organelle but also in the case where secreted proteins were identified in the secretory pathway (ER, ERGDV, Golgi). 'No' was assigned where the measured location was not among the annotated locations for a protein. 'Probably' was assigned in several instances: 1) where no location was otherwise annotated, 2) where a protein annotated as cytosolic was measured in an organelle since it would encounter than organelle and could be specifically associated with it, 3) where a protein annotated as nuclear was found in the cytosol since most proteins are not completely excluded by the nuclear pore, 4) where a non-proteasomal protein was found in the proteasome since most proteins are degraded by this machinery at some point, 5) where cytoskeletal proteins were measured in an organelle. 'Co-migrating' was assigned for ribosomal proteins that peaked in fractions 17 and/or 19.

Each worksheet has been opened in gnumeric and saved as a csv file.

Marker proteins have been extracted from the paper, second paragraph on page 188:

To determine the PCP of well-studied organelles, we
examined the profiles of several well-characterized
marker proteins, including 130 kDa Golgi phosphoprotein
(GPP130, Golgi), AP-2 assembly subunit AP17 (plasma
membrane [PM]), early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1, early
endosomes [EE]), transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2, recycling
endosome [RE]), calnexin (ER), p115 (ER/Golgi-derived
vesicles [ERGDV]), and F1-F0 ATP synthase b subunit (mi-
tochondria). Each of these markers peaked in different
gradient fractions and had distinct profiles; thus at least
these seven organelles could be distinguished with confi-
dence (Figure 2B). Markers of other compartments were
also observed, but their profiles matched closely to one
of the seven mentioned above. In particular, ERGIC-53,
a marker for the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment,
overlapped very closely with the ER, as has been reported
previously (Breuza et al., 2004). Likewise, the profiles of
cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and
adaptor-related protein 1b, markers of the late endosome
and trans-Golgi network, respectively, largely overlapped
with TfR2 (Tables S3 and S4). This suggests that these
compartments migrate similarly in rate-zonal centrifuga-
tion and is in agreement with the specialized conditions re-
quired for even partial segregation reported by others
(Tulp et al., 1998; Hashiramoto and James, 2000).

3 replicates in separate sheets, that have been saved to 3 csv files

original markers.

The two following csv files contain Uniprot ID and Entry Names for the
the proteins that appear in the above 3 datasets. This information has
been downloaded from www.flymine.org using the 'list analysis' tool
using the protein CG numbers as input.

TanFlyMineFiltered.csv 
TanFlyMineUnfiltered.csv 

The filtered dataset contains only Uniprot IDs that have been reviewed
i.e. that come from Swiss-Prot. Some CG numbers give rise to more than
one reviewed Uniprot ID. The unfiltered dataset contains all Uniprot
IDs per CG number which includes corresponding IDs from both
Swiss-Prot (reveiwed) and TrEMBl (unreviewed), again some CG numbers
have multiple IDs. Four columns have been added to the Tan MSnSet
instances to include this information which are called
ProteinAccession, EntryName, ProteinAccessionAll and
EntryNameAll. ProteinAccession contains a single Uniprot accession ID
per protein, for proteins with multiple Uniprot IDs the ID which is
reveiwed appears here, if none are reviewed (or multiple are reviewed)
the ID that appears first in the csv file for that protein is
used. The column ProteinAccessionAll contains all UniprotIDs per
protein (both reviewed and unreviewed). Similarly the columns
EntryName and EntryNameAll conatin the Uniprot entry names for each
protein with EntryName containing only one name and EntryNameAll
containing all names per protein.

Proteomics data provide unique insights into biological systems,
including the predominant subcellular localization (SCL) of proteins,
which can reveal important clues about their functions. Here we
analyzed data of a complete prokaryotic proteome expressed under two
conditions mimicking interaction of the emerging pathogen Bartonella
henselae with its mammalian host. Normalized spectral count data from
cytoplasmic, total membrane, inner and outer membrane fractions
allowed us to identify the predominant SCL for 82% of the identified
proteins. The spectral count proportion of total membrane versus
cytoplasmic fractions indicated the propensity of cytoplasmic proteins
to co-fractionate with the inner membrane, and enabled us to
distinguish cytoplasmic, peripheral inner membrane and bona fide inner
membrane proteins. Principal component analysis and k-nearest neighbor
classification training on selected marker proteins or predominantly
localized proteins, allowed us to determine an extensive catalog of at
least 74 expressed outer membrane proteins, and to extend the SCL
assignment to 94% of the identified proteins, including 18% where in
silico methods gave no prediction. Suitable experimental proteomics
data combined with straightforward computational approaches can thus
identify the predominant SCL on a proteome-wide scale. Finally, we
present a conceptual approach to identify proteins potentially
changing their SCL in a condition-dependent fashion.
