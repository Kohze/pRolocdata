AT4G32150,VAMP711,"AtVAMP711 is a member of Synaptobrevin-like AtVAMP7C, v-SNARE (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) protein family. SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.",Vacuole,GFP,15876431

AT4G03560,TPC1,"Encodes a depolarization-activated Ca(2+) channel. Anti-sense experiments with this gene as well as Sucrose-H(+) symporters and complementation of yeast sucrose uptake mutant cch1 suggest that this protein mediates a voltage-activated Ca(2+ )influx. Mutants lack detectable SV channel activity suggesting TPC1 is essential component of the SV channel.
