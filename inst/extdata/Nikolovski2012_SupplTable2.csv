AT5G06700,"Encodes a member of the TBL (TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE) gene family containing a plant-specific DUF231 (domain of unknown function) domain. TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers. A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication). A tbr mutant is impaired in its ability to deposit secondary wall cellulose in specific cell types, most notably in trichomes.",,DUF231,,Golgi/TGN,1,"Acetyltransferase related","novel Golgi protein localised in this study",,TMD-Golgi,38,57,N-Inside,3,0.134,0.354,0.268,0.244,0.2488652624,0.2914258298,0.2595347571,0.2001247811,0.0972247755,0.3810449248,0.334215549,0.1874580467,0.1508295759,0.3466598357,0.3073111073,0.1951977426,0.1164946714,0.3093102966,0.3329324945,0.2412126535,0.1518521995,0.2927236619,0.3217789833,0.2336162343,0.287,0.295,0.225,0.192,0.208,0.262,0.252,0.278

AT4G39400,"BRI1 (Brassinosteroid-insensitive-1) Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus.",BRI1,"LRR protein kinase",PM,PM,1,PK,,"PM GFP (Friedrichsen et al., 2000)",TMD-PM,792,814,N-Outside,6,0.2012,0.2502,0.254,0.2948,0.3135,0.21475,0.23325,0.23825,0.1923333333,0.2363333333,0.285,0.2866666667,0.1971428571,0.24,0.2727142857,0.2898571429,0.1990293491,0.229083798,0.2641493015,0.3077429367,0.1551961414,0.2886378219,0.2693147729,0.2868333884,0.23375,0.23225,0.25075,0.2835,0.1886666667,0.2166666667,0.3113333333,0.2833333333

However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.
